Revision history for Disk-SMART

0.05    2014-10-08
        Separated out data processing from the getter methods. Getter methods now only return hash data.
        Added methods and unit tests for update_data() and get_disk_attributes(). update_data() can be called at any point in a calling script to update the drive data. This makes it where Disk::SMART can be used in a script called by cron, or a continuously running daemon.
        Updated MANIFEST to include LICENSE file
        Changes to satisfy perl critic
        Simplified get_disk_temp with substr to read the disk temp

0.04    2014-10-06
        Updated Makefile.PL to better interact with Meta::CPAN
        Updated pod for clarity

0.03    2014-10-04

        Refactored methods to return N/A first before any further proessing is done
        Cleaned up unit tests
        get_disk_model() only outputs just the model information now.
        Added get_disk_errors()
        Methods now validate the device passed to it, to ensure smartctl has already read it
        Added unit tests to test passing invalid device to methods
        Changed to croak() as I didn't feel a trace was necessary with proper error returning.

0.02    2014-10-03
        Added confess to new() in case smartctl cannot find the specified device
